# 0x1E C - Search Algorithms :pencil2:

> C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. This projects covers the concepts of searching algoritms as well as  the big o notation for the respective algorithms

At the end of this project, Iwas able to solve these questions:
  
* What is a search algorithm
* What is a linear search
* What is a binary search
* What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm
1. Function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm
2. What is the time complexity (worst case) of a linear search in an array of size n?
3. What is the space complexity (worst case) of an iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size n?
4. What is the time complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n?
5. What is the space complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n?
6. What is the space complexity of this function / algorithm?
